In the darkened ruins of McLean Hall, where the virus was born,
Professor Ray Tomlinson works alone. 
Once a celebrated biochemist, he now toils in silence beneath the hum of dying generators,
surrounded by the echoes of his former students. 
The infection spreads faster than any model predicted,
turning friends, colleagues, and entire neighborhoods into something unrecognizable.
Wracked with guilt and desperation, Tomlinson refuses to flee.
He believes a cure still lies buried within the chaos, a fragment of hope hidden in the data,
or perhaps within the infected themselves. 
But as the nights grow longer and the sounds outside his lab doors become less human,
he begins to wonder whether his pursuit of redemption is already too late.
It is your mission to guide Professor Tomlinson through the quarantined campus,
scavenge the remnants of science amid the wreckage,
and piece together the formula that could save what’s left of humanity.
But beware, each experiment draws attention. 
And in the silence beyond the lab walls… 
the infected are listening.
