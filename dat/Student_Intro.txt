As chaos consumes the streets of Hoboken, 
sirens wail in the distance, and the city burns under a crimson sky. 
Within the crumbling halls of Stevens Institute of Technology, one student remains,
Steve Stevens, a determined senior who refuses to abandon his future, even as the world collapses around his.
His goal is simple: reach the PATH station and escape to safety.
But between his and freedom stands one final, cruel obstacle...
his Introduction to Coding Midterm.
The professors are gone. The lights are fading. 
And something hungry now stalks the corridors.
It is now your mission to guide Steve through the infected campus
and help his reach the train before the last route out of Hoboken falls.
Time is running out.
Will Steve make it to safety… or become just another chapter in the end of the world?
