As chaos consumes the streets of Hoboken, 
sirens wail in the distance, and the city burns under a crimson sky. 
Within the crumbling halls of Stevens Institute of Technology, one student remains,
Andrea Carets, a determined senior who refuses to abandon her future, even as the world collapses around her.
Her goal is simple: reach the PATH station and escape to safety.
But between her and freedom stands one final, cruel obstacle...
her Introduction to Coding Midterm.
The professors are gone. The lights are fading. 
And something hungry now stalks the corridors.
It is now your mission to guide Andrea through the infected campus
and help her reach the train before the last route out of Hoboken falls.
Time is running out.
Will Andrea make it to safetyâ€¦ or become just another chapter in the end of the world?
