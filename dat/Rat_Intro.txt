Beneath the streets of Hoboken, 
where the flicker of streetlights never reaches,
a survivor stirs. 
Rizzo, a streetwise rat born in the steam tunnels under Washington Street,
has always known how to live off humanity's scraps.
But today, something's changed.
The air burns with chemicals, the ground trembles with distant screams,
and the scent of food has turned sharp and wrong.
Above, the humans are panicking, locking doors, fleeing the city
but Rizzo knows only one thing: 
Benny's Pizza on Washington Avenue still smells alive. 
Warm. Fresh. Safe. Maybe even... home.
As the infection spreads through Hoboken, twisting flesh and minds,
Rizzo must navigate the collapsing city to reach his last sanctuary.
Avoid the infected, outwit rival scavengers, 
and cling to the one law that has kept him alive this long:
eat first, run later.
But the city has changed. 
For the first time, Rizzo isn't sure who's hunting who.
