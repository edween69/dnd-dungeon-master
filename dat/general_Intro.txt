On the evening of October 22, 2025,
a group of biochemists at Stevens University of Technology
successfully created a highly infectious,
rapidly mutating strain of the lyssavirus.
Their triumph would soon become humanity’s undoing.
That same night, under the flickering lights of McLean Hall,
a disgraced researcher named Edmin Badman made his way to the 8th floor of McLean Hall
to steal a sample of the dangerous virus in the hope of postponing his upcoming midterm.
By dawn, he had unleashed the virus upon Hoboken, New Jersey,
smearing infection across the city’s most crowded doorways and diners. 
By midday October 23, 2025, 
the virus had spread through most of the population of Hoboken, New Jersey.
