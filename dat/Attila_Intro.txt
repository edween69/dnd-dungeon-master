Once, Attila the Duck was just a symbol of school pride,
a mascot who danced at games, posed for photos, 
and brought laughter to the students of Stevens Institute of Technology. 
But when the infection tore through Hoboken, 
laughter turned to chaos, and Attila’s world went silent.
Somewhere out there, amidst the sirens and smoke, 
Tillie, her loyal dog companion, cared for by student Seb Ashton, was left behind. 
The campus is crawling with infected, 
and Seb hasn't been seen since. 
But Attila remembers her friend's bark echoing through the quad, 
and that sound is enough to light a fire stronger than fear.
Now, as night falls over the shattered campus, 
Attila must brave the blood-streaked hallways
to find Tillie before it's too late.
Feathers or not, she's no ordinary duck anymore. 
She's a survivor.
And she's coming for her friend.
